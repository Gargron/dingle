# Roadmap

__Value proposition__: Right now it is very difficult to choose an Internet Service Provider. You have
to rely on their advertising, your friends' limited experience with the wide range of offers and
Internet forums and shady ad-filled rating websites. __What we want to offer__ is a minimalistic and
independent, clean hub of customer reviews and ratings on different ISPs in different countries,
making the most out of user-submitted information for fellow visitors.

__The actual roadmap__:

* ~~Add pagination to various collections on the site: Ratings, suggestions, providers and countries~~
* ~~Authors can edit their reviews shortly after publishing~~
* Add area availability functionality: Users can claim that a provider is available in an area, we
  compute the statistical confidence of those claims not being bogus and display on a map to
  visitors.
* The same as above, but with download and upload speeds, possibly generated/pulled directly from
  Speedtest.net
* Customize the design a little, add some illustrations
